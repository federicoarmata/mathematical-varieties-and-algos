### Fibonacci Sequence

`python fibonacci.py`

Generate the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence using several algorithms and print 
the lower bound for the time of run for each of them.

The following convention has been used:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 0, 1
F(2) = 0, 1, 1 

and so on.

### Pi

`python pi.py`

Generate pi (checked until the 1000-th decimal digit) with 2 different series:

1) using the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula.
       
2) using a variation of the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula found by F. Bellard.
   See http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PiFormulas.html for more details.
